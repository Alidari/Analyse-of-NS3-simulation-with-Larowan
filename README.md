# Traffic Simulation Project with SUMO, NS3, and LoRaWAN
## Project Overview
This project aims to create a traffic simulation using SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) and NS3 (Network Simulator 3), then analyze the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and latency using LoRaWAN. The simulation data is saved in an NS2-compatible TCL file format and processed to generate graphs displaying the performance metrics.
